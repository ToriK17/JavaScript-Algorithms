// There are three types of edits that can be preformed on strings: insert a character, remove a character, or replace a character. 
// Given two strings, write a function to check if they are one edit 9or zero edits) away. 
// EXAMPLE
/*  pale, ple -> true
    pales, pale -> true
    pale, bale -> true
    pale, bake -> false
